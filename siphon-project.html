            <h3>The Question</h3>
            <p>How much air can flow through a water siphon before it completely stops working?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Industries lose millions when siphon systems fail due to air bubbles, forcing them to use expensive pumps and high-pressure steam to move liquids.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Siphons are used in paper mills, nuclear plants, and irrigation systems. But when bubbles form due to heat or dissolved gases, siphon flow can stop, requiring costly solutions to restart.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>What We Did</h3>
            <p>Our study, presented at the 5th-6th Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC 2021), delved into the critical void fraction (CVF) – the maximum amount of gas/vapor bubbles a siphon can tolerate before its flow is interrupted. We conducted extensive experiments using both volume and weight methods to precisely measure air bubble concentration and its impact on siphon continuity. Furthermore, we explored innovative techniques for re-priming stalled siphons, offering practical solutions for industrial applications.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights & Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remarkable Air Tolerance:</strong> We discovered that siphons can surprisingly sustain up to 66.7% air by volume before flow discontinuity, significantly higher than previously assumed. This finding challenges conventional understanding and opens new avenues for optimizing siphon performance in two-phase flow systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Restart Strategies:</strong> Our research demonstrated effective methods for rejuvenating stalled siphons, crucial for maintaining uninterrupted operations in critical industrial processes. This could drastically reduce reliance on energy-intensive external pumps and high-pressure steam.</li>
                <li><strong>Broad Industrial Relevance:</strong> The insights from this study have direct implications for various industries, including paper manufacturing, nuclear power plants, and water management. By understanding and mitigating siphon discontinuity, we can achieve substantial energy savings and enhance operational reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Advancing Fluid Dynamics:</strong> This work contributes to a deeper understanding of two-phase flow physics within siphon systems, paving the way for more efficient and resilient fluid transport solutions.</li>
